            <p>Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, and Novak Djokovic. 66 Grand Slams, 947 weeks spent at world-ranked No. 1,
                3,455 total match wins. Together, Federer, Nadal, and Djokovic, known as the ‘Big Three’ of tennis, have
                contributed to one of the most dominant eras in all of sports history.</p>

            </div>
            <p>The Grand Slam tournaments are the highest level of achievement on the Association of Tennis
                Professionals (ATP) tour, the top-tier tennis tour for men. Out of the 86 Grand Slams held since 2003,
                the ‘Big Three’ have won over 75%. This is the first year where none of the ‘Big Three’ have won a Grand
                Slam since 2003.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Before the era of the ‘Big Three,’ the most number of Grand Slams won by an individual player was Pete
                Sampras with 14. Djokovic has a record of 24, Nadal with 22, and Federer with 20.</p>

        <section>
            <h2><b>Domination On All Fronts</b></h2>
            <p>Outside of the Grand Slams, the ‘Big Three’ have been equally dominant in the ATP Masters, the second
                most valuable tournament. Djokovic leads with a record 40 titles,
                Nadal with 36, and Federer with 28.</p>
            <p>Winning all those titles gets players points, which improves their ATP ranking. Being ranked No. 1 is the
                dream of any professional tennis player. </p>
            <p>The ‘Big Three’ have been ranked as world No. 1s in singles for a total of 947 weeks: Djokovic for a
                record 428 weeks, Federer for 310, and Nadal for 209. They were ranked in the top ten for 2,697 weeks,
                which is equivalent to around 50 years.</p>

        <section>
            <h2><b>Mountains Of Cash</b></h2>
            <p>Djokovic, Nadal, and Federer make up the top three prize money leaders of all time. They’ve earned a
                total of $450,605,708 over the course of their careers, according to the ATP Tour as of Nov. 17. That
                figure is more than the next 11 highest-earning professional tennis players of all time combined.</p>

            <h2><b>Beyond Tennis</b></h2>
            <p>Over the course of their reign, the ‘Big Three’ have been influential for a generation of tennis players.
                From their product lines to their individual styles of play, they’ve left their stamp on the game of
                tennis.</p>
            <p>Vesa Ponkka, the president of the Junior Tennis Champions Center (JTCC), a tennis training center and
                preparatory school in College Park, Maryland, has been coaching young tennis players for the last 20
                years.</p>
            <p>Ponkka, 53, said the ‘Big Three’ have had a significant impact on many of the players he’s coached and
                said they’ve been influential beyond their tennis ability. </p>

            <p>“Tennis is one of the best sports to teach life skills,” Ponkka said. “The ‘Big Three’ demonstrate an
                incredible ability to learn and persevere, and I hope to teach that.”</p>
            <p>Oftentimes, Ponkka said, players come in requesting for him to teach them how to hit like the ‘Big
                Three’.</p>
            <p>Conrad Decressin, a materials science and engineering major and co-president of club tennis at this
                university, has played tennis since he was five and said he was inspired by Federer. </p>

                </p>

            </div>
            <p>Decressin said he admired Federer’s elegant style of play and aggressiveness, which made him gravitate to
                pick up a racket and play. </p>
            <p>“It looked so effortless when [Federer] played,” Decressin said. “You couldn’t read him.”</p>
            <p>Since being inspired by Federer, Decressin said he’s modeled his style of play after Djokovic, who’s
                known for having one of the best backhand strokes of all time. Decressin said he wanted to have a good
                backhand and decided to look no further than model it after Djokovic’s.</p>

            <h2><b>Stamp On The Game</b></h2>
            <p>The ‘Big Three’ have faded in recent years, with Federer retiring in 2022 and Nadal in 2024. Many
                speculate Djokovic will follow in the coming years. But their legacy will live on, Ponkka said.</p>
            <p>“In every aspect of the game, [the ‘Big Three’] were gamechangers,” Ponkka said. “I doubt that we will
                see anyone for the longest time reach the heights that these three did.”</p>
